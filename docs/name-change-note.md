# Project Name Change: MagSafe Guard

## From "MagSafe BusKill" to "MagSafe Guard"

The project has been renamed to **MagSafe Guard** - a more concise and memorable name that better reflects the application's purpose as a security guard for your Mac.

## Why "MagSafe Guard"?

- **Clearer Purpose**: "Guard" immediately conveys security and protection
- **Simpler**: Easier to say, spell, and remember
- **Professional**: More suitable for a security application
- **Distinctive**: Stands on its own while still acknowledging BusKill inspiration

## What Changed

### Documentation Updates

- ✅ README.md
- ✅ CLAUDE.md
- ✅ requirements.md
- ✅ CONTRIBUTORS.md
- ✅ pr.proto-power-detect.md
- ✅ All new documentation files

### Code Updates

- ✅ Package.swift (already used MagSafeGuard)
- ✅ Source files reference MagSafeGuard

### What Remains

- GitHub repository URL (still magsafe-buskill)
- GitHub Actions workflows (reference repo URL)
- Badges and external links (reference repo URL)

## Acknowledgment

MagSafe Guard remains inspired by and acknowledges the original [BusKill Project](https://github.com/BusKill/BusKill-app). We've adapted their concept specifically for macOS users who rely on MagSafe power adapters.

## Next Steps

When ready to fully transition:

1. Rename GitHub repository to `magsafe-guard`
2. Update all GitHub URLs in documentation
3. Update workflow files
4. Redirect old repository name
