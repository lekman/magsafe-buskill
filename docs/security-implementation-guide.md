# Security-First Implementation Guide for MagSafe Guard

## How Our Security Controls Work Together

This guide explains how to incorporate our comprehensive security toolchain into the development workflow for MagSafe Guard. All security checks are enforced at multiple stages to ensure code quality and security.

## Security Control Layers

### 1. Local Development (Pre-commit)

Before code even reaches GitHub, our local controls catch issues:

```bash
# Run setup to install hooks
task init

# What happens on commit:
1. Pre-commit hook runs security checks
2. Commit message validation ensures conventional commits
3. Local Semgrep scan for security issues
4. Secret detection prevents credential leaks
```

**Key Files:**

- `.githooks/pre-commit` - Security scanning
- `.githooks/commit-msg` - Conventional commit enforcement
- `scripts/security-check.sh` - Local security scanner

### 2. Pull Request Stage

When you create a PR, multiple security gates activate:

```yaml
# Automated PR checks:
- Basic security scans (secrets, permissions)
- CodeQL semantic analysis
- Semgrep SAST scanning
- Dependency vulnerability scanning
- License compliance checks
- Code coverage requirements
```

**Enforcement:**

- Branch protection rules require passing checks
- Security findings block merge
- Coverage must not decrease

### 3. Continuous Integration

Our GitHub Actions workflows provide comprehensive scanning:

#### Security Workflow (`.github/workflows/security.yml`)

```yaml
Triggers:
- Every push to main/develop
- All pull requests
- Daily scheduled scans
- Manual security audits

Jobs:
1. basic-checks     # Fast fail on obvious issues
2. codeql-analysis  # Deep semantic analysis
3. semgrep-scan     # OWASP/security patterns
4. dependency-scan  # Known vulnerabilities
5. snyk-scan        # Advanced SCA (when enabled)
```

#### Test Workflow (`.github/workflows/test.yml`)

```yaml
Includes:
- Swift compilation
- Unit test execution
- Code coverage generation
- Coverage reporting to Codecov
```

### 4. Development Automation (Taskfile)

Our Taskfile provides convenient security commands:

```bash
# Security-related tasks
task security:check    # Run all security scans
task lint:fix         # Fix code style issues
task test             # Run tests with coverage
task init             # Set up git hooks

# All tasks use 'silent' mode to reduce noise
```

### 5. Continuous Monitoring

Even after merge, security continues:

- **Daily Scans**: New vulnerabilities detected
- **Dependabot**: Automated security updates
- **GitHub Security**: Real-time alerts
- **Release Process**: Security changelog

## Practical Workflow Example

Here's how security integrates into a typical feature development:

```bash
# 1. Start feature
git checkout -b feature/secure-config

# 2. Develop with confidence
# - Pre-commit hooks catch issues locally
# - No secrets can be committed

# 3. Commit with conventional format
git commit -m "feat: add encrypted configuration storage"
# Hook validates format and runs security scan

# 4. Push and create PR
git push origin feature/secure-config
# GitHub Actions run full security suite

# 5. Address any findings
# - PR comments show issues
# - Clear remediation steps provided

# 6. Merge when all checks pass
# - Security gate enforced
# - Coverage maintained
```

## Security Requirements in PRD

The PRD now includes specific security requirements:

### Development Security

- All code must pass security scans before merge
- Conventional commits required for clear history
- Test coverage must not decrease
- Security vulnerabilities must be fixed before release

### Application Security

- Authentication required for all state changes
- No telemetry or data collection
- Local processing only
- Secure credential storage in Keychain
- Signed and notarized distribution

## Quick Reference Commands

```bash
# Local security check
task security:check

# Fix markdown issues
task lint:fix

# Run tests with coverage
task test

# Set up development environment
task init

# Manual security scan
./scripts/security-check.sh

# Check commit message format
echo "feat: my feature" | ./.githooks/commit-msg
```

## Security Tool Dashboard

Monitor all security tools from one place:

| Tool | Purpose | Access |
|------|---------|--------|
| **GitHub Security** | Overview of all security features | [→ Security tab](https://github.com/lekman/magsafe-buskill/security) |
| **CodeQL** | Code analysis results | [→ Security > Code scanning](https://github.com/lekman/magsafe-buskill/security/code-scanning) |
| **Semgrep** | SAST findings | [→ Semgrep Dashboard](https://semgrep.dev) |
| **Dependabot** | Dependency updates | [→ Security > Dependabot](https://github.com/lekman/magsafe-buskill/security/dependabot) |
| **Codecov** | Test coverage | [→ Codecov Dashboard](https://codecov.io/gh/lekman/magsafe-buskill) |

## Best Practices

### For Contributors

1. **Always run `task init`** after cloning
2. **Use conventional commits** for clear history
3. **Run `task security:check`** before pushing
4. **Address security findings** promptly
5. **Keep dependencies updated** via Dependabot

### For Maintainers

1. **Review security alerts** daily
2. **Prioritize security PRs** from bots
3. **Update security tools** regularly
4. **Document security decisions** in ADRs
5. **Celebrate security improvements** in releases
