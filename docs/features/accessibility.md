## Features

### VoiceOver Support

The application provides comprehensive VoiceOver support through:

#### Menu Bar Integration

- Status item has descriptive accessibility label: "MagSafe Guard"
- Current system status is announced as the accessibility value
- Contextual help describes available actions
- State changes are automatically announced

- All text maintains proper contrast ratios (4.5:1 for normal text, 3:1 for large text)

### Audio and Visual Alerts

Multiple notification methods ensure accessibility:

#### Audio Alerts

- VoiceOver announcements for state changes
- System notification sounds follow user preferences
- Important alerts use high-priority VoiceOver announcements

#### Visual Alerts

- Status icon changes reflect system state
- Menu bar integration provides constant visual feedback
- System notifications appear when appropriate

## Implementation Details

### AccessibilityManager

The `AccessibilityManager` class provides centralized accessibility functionality:

```swift
// Configure accessibility features
AccessibilityManager.shared.configureVoiceOverSupport()
AccessibilityManager.shared.configureKeyboardNavigation()

// Perform accessibility audit
let auditResults = AccessibilityManager.shared.performAccessibilityAudit()
```

### Accessibility Extensions

Helper extensions provide easy accessibility configuration:

```swift
// Configure menu items with accessibility
let menuItem = NSMenuItem.accessibleMenuItem(
    title: "Arm System",
    hint: "Enable security protection",
    keyEquivalent: "a"
)

// Configure VoiceOver announcements
AccessibilityAnnouncement.announceStateChange(
    component: "Security System", 
    newState: "Armed"
)
```

### Audit Functionality

Built-in accessibility auditing helps maintain compliance:

- Menu bar accessibility verification
- Keyboard navigation testing
- VoiceOver compatibility checking
- Color contrast validation
- WCAG 2.1 AA compliance monitoring

## Testing Accessibility

### Manual Testing

1. **VoiceOver Testing**:
   - Enable VoiceOver (Cmd+F5)
   - Navigate through the menu bar application
   - Verify all elements are properly announced
   - Test state change announcements

2. **Keyboard Navigation**:
   - Use only keyboard to access all features
   - Verify all shortcuts work as expected
   - Test tab order in windows

3. **High Contrast Testing**:
   - Enable high contrast mode in System Preferences
   - Verify status icon remains visible and clear
   - Check menu readability

### Automated Testing

The application includes automated accessibility testing:

```swift
// Run accessibility audit
let results = AccessibilityManager.shared.performAccessibilityAudit()

// Check for compliance issues
let issues = results.filter { !$0.isCompliant }
```

## Compliance

### WCAG 2.1 AA Standards

The application meets the following WCAG 2.1 AA criteria:

- **1.1.1 Non-text Content**: All images have appropriate accessibility descriptions
- **2.1.1 Keyboard**: All functionality is available via keyboard
- **2.1.2 No Keyboard Trap**: Users can navigate away from any component
- **3.2.1 On Focus**: Focus changes don't cause unexpected context changes
- **4.1.2 Name, Role, Value**: All UI elements have appropriate accessibility properties

### Platform Standards

- Follows Apple's Accessibility Guidelines
- Uses standard AppKit accessibility APIs
- Integrates with system accessibility preferences
- Supports all standard assistive technologies

## Maintenance

### Regular Audits

Accessibility should be verified regularly:

1. Run built-in accessibility audit after changes
2. Test with actual assistive technologies
3. Verify compliance with updated standards
4. Update accessibility labels as features change

### Code Reviews

All code changes should consider accessibility:

- New UI elements must include accessibility properties
- State changes should include appropriate announcements
- Keyboard shortcuts must be documented and consistent
- High contrast mode compatibility should be verified
