## Introduction

MagSafe Guard is a macOS security application that demonstrates how modern open source projects can implement enterprise-grade security practices without enterprise budgets. Every tool in our security stack is free for open source projects.

### Why Security-First Matters

- **Trust**: Security applications must be trustworthy
- **Transparency**: Open source demands openness about security practices
- **Community**: Contributors need clear security guidelines
- **Compliance**: Many users require security attestations

## The Security-First Mindset

### Starting with Security

Instead of adding security later, we built it into the foundation:

1. **Threat Modeling First**: Before writing code, we identified threats
2. **Security Requirements**: Defined in `docs/SECURITY.md` from day one
3. **Secure Defaults**: Every feature defaults to the most secure option
4. **Principle of Least Privilege**: Minimal permissions requested

### Security as a Feature

We treat security as a primary feature, not an afterthought:

```yaml
# In our requirements.md
Security Requirements:
  - Authentication required for all state changes
  - No telemetry or data collection
  - Local processing only
  - Secure credential storage
```

## SSDLC Implementation

### 1. Planning Phase

**Security Activities:**

- Threat modeling using STRIDE methodology
- Security requirements documentation
- Privacy impact assessment
- Technology stack security review

**Artifacts Created:**

- `docs/SECURITY.md` - Security policy
- `docs/architecture/auth-flow-design.md` - Authentication design
- Threat model diagrams

### 2. Development Phase

**Security Practices:**

- Secure coding guidelines
- Pre-commit security hooks
- Local secret scanning
- Dependency management

**Implementation:**

```bash
# .githooks/pre-commit
#!/bin/bash
# Scan for secrets before committing
task test:security || exit 1
```

### 3. Testing Phase

**Security Testing:**

- Static Application Security Testing (SAST)
- Software Composition Analysis (SCA)
- Secret scanning
- License compliance

**Automated via CI/CD:**

```yaml
# Every commit triggers security scans
- CodeQL (SAST)
- Semgrep (SAST)
- Snyk (SCA)
- TruffleHog (Secrets)
```

### 4. Release Phase

**Security Controls:**

- Automated changelog generation
- Security advisory process
- Coordinated disclosure policy
- Signed commits and releases

### 5. Maintenance Phase

**Ongoing Security:**

- Daily dependency scans
- Security patch automation
- Incident response plan
- Regular security reviews

    end

    C --> D

```

## Automation & CI/CD

### Security Workflow Design

Our main security workflow (`.github/workflows/security.yml`) runs:

1. **On Every Push**: Immediate feedback
2. **On Pull Requests**: Block insecure changes
3. **Daily Schedule**: Catch new vulnerabilities
4. **Manual Trigger**: Security audits

### Workflow Optimization

```yaml
jobs:
  # Run basic checks first (fast fail)
  basic-checks:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - Secret detection
      - File permission checks
      - Security TODOs scan

  # Parallel advanced scans
  advanced-scans:
    needs: basic-checks
    strategy:
      matrix:
        scan: [codeql, semgrep, snyk]
```

### Security Workflow Permissions

Following the principle of least privilege:

```yaml
# Global permissions (read-only)
permissions:
  contents: read
  actions: read

# Job-specific elevated permissions
jobs:
  codeql:
    permissions:
      security-events: write  # Only for SARIF upload
```

### Pre-commit Integration

Local security checks before code reaches CI:

```yaml
# .pre-commit-config.yaml
repos:
  - repo: https://github.com/Yelp/detect-secrets
    hooks:
      - id: detect-secrets
  - repo: https://github.com/pre-commit/pre-commit-hooks
    hooks:
      - id: check-yaml
      - id: check-added-large-files
```
