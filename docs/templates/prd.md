# PRD Preparation Rules

## Purpose

Guide the creation of comprehensive Product Requirements Documents that align with business objectives and user needs.

## Structure Requirements

### Background Section

- **Problem Statement**: Quantify the problem with data
- **Market Opportunity**: Include market size and growth projections
- **User Personas**: Define 2-3 specific personas with clear pain points. For shorter initiatives, include only 1 personas - for example an internal/developer addition or a specific tool change that is not targeted for external users/team members.
- **Vision Statement**: One paragraph maximum, aligned with company goals
- **System Context**: Always include C4 context diagram showing stakeholders and external systems

### Objectives Section

- **SMART Goals**: Every goal must be measurable with specific targets
- **KPIs**: Define 3-5 key metrics with baseline and target values
- **Risk Mitigation**: Include top 3-5 risks with mitigation strategies

### Features Section

- **Core Features**: List in priority order using MoSCoW method
- **User Benefits**: Link each feature to specific persona pain points
- **Technical Specifications**: Include high-level technical requirements
- **Future Enhancements**: Separate section for post-MVP features

### User Experience Section

- **UI Design**: Include wireframes or mockups for key flows
- **User Journey**: Map critical paths with decision points
- **Accessibility**: Reference WCAG 2.1 AA compliance requirements

### Milestones Section

- **Development Phases**: Use clear phase names (Discovery, Alpha, Beta, GA)
- **Launch Plan**: Include go/no-go criteria
- **Post-Launch**: Define success metrics for 30/60/90 days

## Content Guidelines

### Language

- Use active voice and present tense
- Avoid jargon unless defining technical requirements
- Keep sentences under 25 words where possible
- Use bullet points for lists over 3 items

### Specificity

- Replace "improve performance" with "reduce load time to <2 seconds"
- Replace "many users" with specific percentages or numbers
- Replace "better UX" with measurable improvements

### Diagrams

- Always include C4 System Context diagram
- Use Mermaid for all diagrams
- Provide edit links to Mermaid Live Editor

## Quality Checks

Before finalising:

1. All sections have quantifiable metrics
2. Features map to user personas
3. Technical feasibility confirmed
4. Risks identified and mitigated
5. Timeline is realistic with buffer
6. Success criteria clearly defined
