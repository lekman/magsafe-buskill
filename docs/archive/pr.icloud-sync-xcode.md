## Summary

This PR implements comprehensive iCloud synchronization functionality for MagSafe Guard, migrates the project to Xcode structure with CloudKit integration, and includes significant refactoring to improve code maintainability and testability. The implementation allows users to sync their security settings across multiple devices using iCloud, providing seamless configuration management for users with multiple Macs.

## Type of Change

- [x] ‚ú® New feature (non-breaking change which adds functionality)
- [x] ‚ôªÔ∏è Code refactoring
- [x] üìö Documentation update
- [x] üîß Configuration change

## Related Issue

- Implements iCloud sync feature from the PRD Phase 4 roadmap
- Addresses future enhancement for "Cloud Sync - Settings synchronization"
- Part of the smart features implementation for enhanced user experience

## Changes

### Major Features

- **iCloud Sync Implementation**

  - Added CloudKit integration for settings synchronization
  - Created `SyncService` with robust error handling and retry logic
  - Implemented CloudSyncSettingsView for user control
  - Added sync status indicators and real-time updates

- **Project Structure Migration**

  - Migrated from Swift Package Manager to Xcode project structure
  - Configured CloudKit container and entitlements
  - Updated build configurations for proper signing

- **Code Refactoring**
  - Refactored SyncService into modular components:
    - `SyncServiceSetup` - CloudKit initialization
    - `SyncServiceMonitor` - iCloud availability monitoring
    - `SyncServiceSettings` - Settings synchronization logic
  - Improved testability with protocol-based dependency injection
  - Enhanced error handling and crash prevention

### Technical Improvements

- Enhanced feature flags system for better control
- Improved UI with sidebar navigation for settings
- Added comprehensive logging and debugging capabilities
- Fixed multiple UI and threading issues
- Removed obsolete demo functionality and resources

### Documentation

- Added crash prevention guide for maintainers
- Created debugging guide for sync issues
- Updated test documentation with CI parameters
- Created **Task 18** for future PowerMonitorService refactoring

## Screenshots (if applicable)

The PR includes UI updates for the settings window with new sidebar navigation and iCloud sync settings panel with real-time status updates.

## Testing

### How Has This Been Tested?

- [x] Unit tests
- [x] Integration tests
- [x] Manual testing
- [x] Tested on physical device

### Test Configuration

- macOS Version: 13.0+ (Ventura and later)
- Hardware: MacBook Pro with MagSafe 3
- Power Adapter Type: Apple 140W USB-C Power Adapter
- Additional testing with USB-C power adapters

### Test Coverage

- SyncService unit tests with mocked CloudKit interactions
- Integration tests for sync functionality
- UI tests for settings synchronization
- Manual testing of:
  - Initial sync setup
  - Settings synchronization between devices
  - Error handling and recovery
  - Network disconnection scenarios
  - iCloud availability changes

## Security Considerations

- [x] No secrets or sensitive data exposed
- [x] Authentication flows tested
- [x] Permissions are appropriately scoped
- [x] Security scanning passed (check workflow results)

### Security Implementation Details

- CloudKit uses user's private database (no shared data)
- Settings encrypted in transit by CloudKit
- No sensitive data (passwords, keys) stored in sync
- Sync can be disabled by user at any time
- Local-first approach - works without iCloud

## Checklist

## Additional Notes

### Architecture Decisions

- Chose CloudKit over custom sync solution for security and reliability
- Implemented modular architecture for SyncService to improve testability
- Used protocol-based design to enable mocking in tests
- Maintained backward compatibility - app works without iCloud

### Known Limitations

- Sync requires iCloud account and sufficient storage
- Initial sync may take a few seconds depending on network
- Some settings (like custom scripts) have size limitations in CloudKit

### Performance Considerations

- Sync operations are async and don't block UI
- Implements retry logic with exponential backoff
- Caches sync status to minimize CloudKit queries
- CPU usage remains below 1% during idle monitoring

## Post-Merge Tasks

- [x] Update CHANGELOG.md (if not using release-please)
- [ ] Notify team of breaking changes (none in this PR)
- [x] Update deployment documentation
- [ ] Monitor CloudKit dashboard for sync issues post-launch
