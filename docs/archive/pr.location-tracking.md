## Summary

This PR implements comprehensive evidence collection capabilities for MagSafe Guard, adding location tracking and photo capture features that activate when theft is detected. The implementation provides encrypted local storage and optional email backup for collected evidence, enhancing the security response system.

## Type of Change

- [x] ✨ New feature (non-breaking change which adds functionality)
- [x] ♻️ Code refactoring
- [x] 🔒 Security fix

## Related Issue

Implements location tracking feature as specified in the PRD Phase 1 requirements for enhanced theft protection.

## Changes

- Implemented `SecurityEvidenceService` with location tracking and photo capture capabilities
- Added encrypted local storage for evidence using AES-GCM encryption with Keychain-stored keys
- Created new settings UI (`SecurityEvidenceSettingsView`) for configuring evidence collection
- Extended `SettingsModel` with evidence collection configuration options
- Integrated evidence collection into `AppController` security action flow
- Removed demo screen functionality and related test files
- Fixed SwiftDoc violations by adding comprehensive documentation
- Fixed code quality issues (duplicate literals, naming conflicts, refactored system paths)

## Screenshots (if applicable)

Evidence collection settings are accessible through Settings > Evidence Collection

## Testing

### How Has This Been Tested?

- [x] Unit tests
- [x] Integration tests
- [x] Manual testing
- [ ] Tested on physical device

### Test Configuration

- macOS Version: macOS 15.0 (Sonoma)
- Hardware: MacBook Pro
- Power Adapter Type: USB-C

## Security Considerations

- [x] No secrets or sensitive data exposed
- [x] Authentication flows tested
- [x] Permissions are appropriately scoped
- [x] Security scanning passed (check workflow results)

### Additional Security Features

- Evidence data is encrypted using AES-GCM before storage
- Encryption keys are stored securely in macOS Keychain
- Camera and location permissions required with user consent
- Email backup is optional and requires explicit configuration

## Additional Notes

### Implementation Details

1. **Location Tracking**: Uses CoreLocation framework with "Always" authorization for background updates
2. **Photo Capture**: Uses AVFoundation to capture photos from the front-facing camera
3. **Storage**: Evidence is encrypted and stored in `~/Documents/Evidence/` directory
4. **Email Integration**: Uses NSSharingService for email composition with attachments

### Code Quality Improvements

- Removed all SwiftDoc violations by adding comprehensive documentation
- Fixed duplicate literal issues by defining constants
- Refactored system paths to be customizable via environment variables
- Renamed reserved keyword function from `if` to `when`
- Removed entire demo screen implementation

### Testing Coverage

- Added `SecurityEvidenceServiceTests` with mock implementations
- Updated existing tests to handle new evidence collection flow
- All tests pass with SwiftLint reporting 0 violations

## Post-Merge Tasks

- [ ] Update CHANGELOG.md (if not using release-please)
- [ ] Notify team of breaking changes
- [x] Update deployment documentation
- [ ] Other: Update user documentation with evidence collection guide
