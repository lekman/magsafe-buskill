## Related Issue

Relates to Task #13: Implement Accessibility Features

## Changes

### Accessibility Features

- Implemented comprehensive VoiceOver support with custom announcements
- Added full keyboard navigation for all UI controls
- Enhanced color contrast to meet WCAG 2.1 AA standards
- Created AccessibilityManager for centralized accessibility handling
- Added accessibility audit capabilities with severity levels
- Implemented semantic accessibility hints and labels throughout the UI

### Code Quality Improvements

- Fixed all SonarCloud maintainability issues:
  - Refactored hardcoded URIs in MacSystemActions.swift to use configurable paths
  - Fixed nested closure complexity in TrustedLocationsView.swift
  - Resolved 6 hardcoded path issues by implementing environment variable configuration
- Added comprehensive documentation for all public accessibility APIs
- Refactored TrustedLocationsView for better maintainability
- Updated Swift setup tasks with improved installation checks

### Documentation & Infrastructure

- Transitioned documentation from Xcode project to Swift Package structure
- Updated README with clearer development and debugging instructions
- Enhanced VSCode settings for better development experience
- Fixed SwiftLint documentation warnings
- Updated SBOM generation with correct timestamps

### Development Workflow

- Improved all setup tasks to check for existing installations
- Set jazzy to use --user-install by default with Ruby version checking
- Added comprehensive error handling for tool installations
- Enhanced task automation with better feedback messages

## Screenshots (if applicable)

The accessibility features are not visually apparent but can be tested with VoiceOver enabled. Key improvements include:

- Menu bar icon properly announces state changes
- Settings window navigation with keyboard
- Clear focus indicators on all interactive elements

## Testing

### How Has This Been Tested?

- [x] Unit tests
- [x] Manual testing
- [x] Tested on physical device
- [x] VoiceOver testing
- [x] Keyboard navigation testing
- [x] Color contrast analysis

### Test Configuration

- macOS Version: 14.0+ (Sonoma)
- Hardware: MacBook Pro with Touch Bar
- Power Adapter Type: USB-C
- Accessibility Tools: VoiceOver, Accessibility Inspector

## Security Considerations

- [x] No secrets or sensitive data exposed
- [x] Authentication flows tested
- [x] Permissions are appropriately scoped
- [x] Security scanning passed (check workflow results)

## Additional Notes

### Accessibility Implementation Details

1. **VoiceOver Support**: All UI elements now have proper accessibility labels and hints. The AccessibilityAnnouncement struct provides a clean API for posting announcements.

2. **Keyboard Navigation**: Full keyboard support implemented with proper focus management and tab ordering.

3. **Color Contrast**: All text and UI elements meet WCAG 2.1 AA contrast requirements (4.5:1 for normal text, 3:1 for large text).

4. **Accessibility Audit**: The AccessibilityManager can perform runtime audits to ensure continued compliance.

### Sonar Code Quality Improvements

- Resolved all SonarCloud issues in the current branch
- Improved code maintainability by extracting hardcoded paths as constants
- Reduced complexity in TrustedLocationsView by refactoring nested closures

### Development Experience

- The project now uses `task run` as the primary way to run the menu bar app
- Debugging instructions updated for Swift Package structure
- All setup tasks now intelligently check for existing installations

## Post-Merge Tasks

- [x] Update CHANGELOG.md (if not using release-please)
- [ ] Notify team of breaking changes
- [ ] Update deployment documentation
- [ ] Other: Consider creating an accessibility testing guide
