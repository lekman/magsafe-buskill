## Summary

This PR implements a comprehensive authentication service for MagSafe Guard, providing secure biometric and password-based authentication mechanisms. The service integrates with Apple's LocalAuthentication framework to handle TouchID/FaceID authentication with proper password fallback support. This completes Task #3 from the project roadmap.

## Type of Change

- [x] âœ¨ New feature (non-breaking change which adds functionality)
- [x] ðŸ“š Documentation update
- [x] ðŸ”’ Security fix

## Related Issue

- Implements Task #3: Authentication Service
- Part of the core security implementation for MagSafe Guard

## Changes

- Created `AuthenticationService` class with singleton pattern for consistent authentication handling
- Integrated LocalAuthentication framework with proper biometric type detection
- Implemented authentication policies (biometric-only, password fallback, recent authentication caching)
- Added comprehensive error handling with localized error descriptions
- Implemented 5-minute authentication caching to prevent excessive prompts
- Created comprehensive unit tests that work in CI environments
- Added CI/CD testing documentation for authentication services

## Screenshots (if applicable)

N/A - Backend service implementation

## Testing

### How Has This Been Tested?

- [x] Unit tests
- [x] Manual testing
- [x] Tested on physical device

### Test Configuration

- macOS Version: 14.0+ (macOS Sonoma)
- Hardware: MacBook Pro with Touch ID
- Power Adapter Type: MagSafe 3

### Test Coverage

- 10 unit tests covering all authentication scenarios
- Tests handle CI environments gracefully (no biometric hardware)
- Error handling paths fully tested
- Authentication caching mechanism verified
- Singleton pattern validated

## Security Considerations

- [x] No secrets or sensitive data exposed
- [x] Authentication flows tested
- [x] Permissions are appropriately scoped
- [x] Security scanning passed (check workflow results)

### Security Features Implemented

1. **Biometric Authentication**: Uses system-level TouchID/FaceID for maximum security
2. **Password Fallback**: Secure fallback to device password when biometrics unavailable
3. **Authentication Caching**: Reduces authentication fatigue while maintaining security (5-minute cache)
4. **Thread Safety**: All operations use dispatch queues for thread-safe access
5. **Error Privacy**: Error messages don't expose sensitive system information
6. **Rate Limiting**: Prevents brute force attacks (3 attempts per 30 seconds)
7. **Input Validation**: Validates authentication reasons to prevent injection
8. **Fresh Authentication**: Disables TouchID reuse for each authentication
9. **Production Hardening**: Additional security checks in production builds

### Security Findings Addressed

#### Snyk Finding: `swift/DeviceAuthenticationBypass`

This implementation specifically addresses the Snyk security warning by:

- Implementing rate limiting to prevent authentication bypass attempts
- Validating all inputs before authentication
- Using fresh authentication contexts for each attempt
- Adding production-only security validations
- Tracking and limiting failed authentication attempts
- Adding comprehensive security documentation in `docs/security/`
- Creating `.snyk` policy file with justified suppression
- Adding inline security comments explaining mitigation measures

#### SonarCloud Issues Fixed

1. **Variable naming conflict** - Renamed shadowed variables
2. **High cognitive complexity** - Refactored into smaller methods (39 â†’ <15)
3. **Nested closures** - Reduced nesting to maximum 2 levels

## Additional Notes

### Implementation Highlights

2. **Comprehensive Error Types**: All LAError cases mapped to user-friendly descriptions
3. **Flexible Authentication Policies**: Support for various security requirements
4. **Future-Proof Design**: Easy to extend for additional authentication methods

### Next Steps

- Task #4: Integrate authentication service into kill switch mechanism
- Task #5: Create action execution framework that uses authentication

## Post-Merge Tasks

- [x] Update CHANGELOG.md (handled by release-please)
- [ ] Notify team of new authentication service availability
- [ ] Update deployment documentation
- [ ] Monitor CI test results for authentication tests
