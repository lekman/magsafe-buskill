# Initial MagSafe Guard Implementation

## Summary

This PR introduces the initial implementation of MagSafe Guard (formerly MagSafe BusKill), a macOS security application that uses the power adapter connection as a theft protection mechanism. The implementation includes proof-of-concept prototypes, comprehensive documentation, and automated release workflows.

## Changes

### Features

- **Power Monitoring Prototypes**:
  - Basic POC (`PowerMonitorPOC.swift`) demonstrating IOKit power adapter detection
  - Advanced interactive demo (`PowerMonitorAdvanced.swift`) with configurable security actions
  - Proven technical feasibility with <100ms response time

- **Documentation Suite**:
  - Comprehensive technical requirements (`requirements.md`)
  - Authentication flow design with TouchID/password support
  - Configuration schema and examples (YAML-based)
  - Menu bar UI design guide
  - Figma setup and integration instructions
  - Contributor guidelines
  - Security policy (`docs/SECURITY.md`)
  - Semgrep integration guide (`docs/semgrep.md`)

- **Project Infrastructure**:
  - Release automation using release-please
  - Changelog management in `docs/` folder
  - Pre-release versioning strategy (0.x.x)
  - GitHub App integration for automated PR approval
  - GitHub Advanced Security workflows (CodeQL, dependency scanning, secret detection)
  - Security policy and audit workflows
  - CODEOWNERS configuration for automatic review assignments
  - Git hooks for pre-commit security scanning and conventional commits
  - Taskfile for streamlined development workflow
  - PR template for consistent pull request format

### Technical Details

- Uses IOKit framework for power state monitoring
- No kernel extensions required (userspace only)
- Supports all power adapter types (MagSafe, USB-C, third-party)
- Planned SwiftUI implementation for menu bar interface

## Testing

### Manual Testing

- ✅ Power monitoring POC tested on macOS
- ✅ Verified detection of power adapter connect/disconnect events
- ✅ Tested interactive demo with various security actions
- ✅ Release workflow configuration validated

### Test Environment

- macOS 14.x (Sonoma)
- Both MagSafe and USB-C power adapters

## Security Implementations

- **GitHub Advanced Security**:
  - CodeQL analysis for Swift code
  - Dependency vulnerability scanning
  - Secret detection with TruffleHog
  - SAST with Semgrep (optional with token)
  - Security Scorecard integration
  - License compliance checking

- **Security Workflows**:
  - Integrated security scanning combining basic and advanced checks
  - Basic checks: secrets, permissions, TODOs (always run)
  - Advanced scanning: CodeQL, Semgrep, dependency review
  - Manual security audit workflow for on-demand analysis
  - Fixed shell injection vulnerabilities in workflows

## Commits

- feat: add release-please configuration and workflows for automated releases
- feat: add initial configuration files and README for MagSafe Guard project
- feat: prototype to implement authentication flow and configuration for MagSafe Guard
- feat: add GitHub Advanced Security workflows and documentation
- fix: resolve security workflow issues and license compatibility
