## Summary

This PR implements the Security Actions Service (Task 4 from PRD) with a robust protocol-based architecture, comprehensive test coverage, and security workflow enhancements. The implementation provides the core security response system for MagSafe Guard, enabling configurable actions when power is disconnected while armed.

## Type of Change

- [x] ‚ú® New feature (non-breaking change which adds functionality)
- [x] ‚ôªÔ∏è Code refactoring
- [x] üîí Security fix
- [x] üìö Documentation update

## Related Issue

- Implements Task 4: Security Actions Service from the PRD
- Addresses security requirements for theft-prevention actions
- Enhances CI/CD security by fixing shell injection vulnerabilities

## Changes

### Core Implementation

- **SecurityActionsService**: Main service for executing security actions

  - Protocol-based architecture with `SystemActionsProtocol` for dependency injection
  - Configurable delay between actions to prevent system overload
  - Comprehensive error handling and logging
  - Support for all required actions: screen lock, alarm, logout, shutdown, script execution

- **Authentication Refactoring**: Protocol-based authentication for testability

  - `AuthenticationContextProtocol` for abstracting LAContext
  - Factory pattern for creating real vs mock contexts
  - 100% test coverage for authentication logic

- **System Integration**: Clean separation of concerns
  - `MacSystemActions`: Real implementation of system calls
  - `MockSystemActions`: Test double for unit testing
  - No system actions executed during tests

### Testing Enhancements

- **Comprehensive Test Suite**: 83.71% overall coverage (exceeds 80% requirement)

  - Full unit tests for SecurityActionsService
  - Mock-based tests for AuthenticationService
  - Integration tests for AppDelegateCore
  - Protocol-based testing strategy documented

- **Testing Infrastructure**:
  - Created testing guide documenting protocol-based architecture
  - Manual acceptance test guide for system integration features
  - CI environment parameter documentation

### Security Improvements

- **GitHub Workflow Security**: Fixed shell injection vulnerabilities
  - Environment variables for GitHub context values
  - Proper escaping in all shell scripts
  - Security workflow enhancements

### Documentation

- **Testing Strategy**: Comprehensive guides added
  - `docs/maintainers/testing-guide.md`: Protocol-based testing architecture
  - `docs/maintainers/acceptance-tests.md`: Manual test procedures
  - Updated CLAUDE.md with testing references

N/A - Backend service implementation

## Testing

### How Has This Been Tested?

- [x] Unit tests
- [x] Integration tests
- [x] Manual testing
- [x] Tested on physical device

### Test Configuration

- macOS Version: 14.0+ (Sonoma)
- Hardware: MacBook Pro with MagSafe 3
- Power Adapter Type: Apple 140W USB-C Power Adapter

### Test Coverage Results

```text
Test Suite 'All tests' passed
Executed 41 tests, with 0 failures
Coverage: 83.71% (Target: 80%)
```

## Security Considerations

- [x] No secrets or sensitive data exposed
- [x] Authentication flows tested
- [x] Permissions are appropriately scoped
- [x] Security scanning passed (check workflow results)

### Additional Security Notes

- System actions are executed through protocol abstraction
- Authentication required for all security-sensitive operations
- No direct system calls in test environment
- Shell injection vulnerabilities fixed in CI/CD

## Additional Notes

### Architecture Decisions

1. **Protocol-Based Design**: Enables complete unit test coverage without system side effects
2. **Factory Pattern**: Clean separation between production and test environments
3. **Comprehensive Mocking**: All system interactions can be verified without execution

### Testing Philosophy

- Business logic separated from system interfaces
- Mock objects for deterministic testing
- Manual acceptance tests for system integration
- CI environment parameters for test behavior control

### Future Considerations

- Grace period cancellation (Task 4.6) deferred to future implementation
- Configuration UI for security actions pending (Task 6)
- Additional security actions can be easily added through the protocol

## Post-Merge Tasks

- [x] Update CHANGELOG.md (handled by release-please)
- [ ] Notify team of breaking changes (N/A - no breaking changes)
- [ ] Update deployment documentation (N/A - library component)
- [x] Update taskmaster status (Task 4 marked as complete)

## Reviewer Notes

1. **Security Review Focus**:

   - Verify protocol implementation prevents unauthorized action execution
   - Check authentication flows in both services
   - Review shell injection fixes in workflows

2. **Testing Review**:

   - Confirm no system actions execute during tests
   - Verify mock implementations cover all scenarios
   - Check test coverage meets requirements

3. **Code Quality**:
   - Protocol abstractions are properly documented
   - Error handling is comprehensive
   - Logging provides adequate debugging information
