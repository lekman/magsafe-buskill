## Summary

This PR implements comprehensive Settings UI and persistence functionality for MagSafe Guard (Task #7), providing users with a native macOS preferences interface to configure all security and behavior settings. The implementation includes a full SwiftUI settings window with tabbed navigation, persistent storage using UserDefaults, and integration with the existing AppController to apply settings in real-time.

## Type of Change

- [x] ‚ú® New feature (non-breaking change which adds functionality)
- [x] üìö Documentation update
- [x] ‚ôªÔ∏è Code refactoring
- [x] üîí Security fix

## Related Issue

- Implements Task #7 from the Product Requirements Document
- Addresses requirement for user-configurable security settings
- Fulfills MVP requirement for configuration UI

## Changes

### Core Implementation

- **Settings Model (`SettingsModel.swift`)**: Comprehensive data model for all user preferences with validation
- **Settings View (`SettingsView.swift`)**: Native SwiftUI settings interface with 5 tabbed sections
- **UserDefaults Manager (`UserDefaultsManager.swift`)**: Persistence layer with automatic saving and migration support
- **AppController Integration**: Real-time settings application for grace period and security configurations

### UI Components

- **General Tab**: Grace period duration, cancellation settings, startup preferences
- **Security Tab**: Security action selection and configuration
- **Auto-Arm Tab**: Location and network-based automatic arming rules
- **Notifications Tab**: Alert preferences and status notifications
- **Advanced Tab**: Debug logging, telemetry, and power management settings

### Additional Improvements

- Enhanced test coverage for AppController and NotificationService
- Fixed GitHub workflow security permissions (removed top-level write access)
- Cleaned up Figma documentation references
- Updated project documentation to reflect new settings functionality

## Screenshots (if applicable)

The Settings UI provides a native macOS preferences window accessible via:

- Menu bar ‚Üí Settings... (‚åò,)
- Standard macOS settings integration

## Testing

### How Has This Been Tested?

- [x] Unit tests
- [x] Integration tests
- [x] Manual testing
- [x] Tested on physical device

### Test Configuration

- macOS Version: macOS 14.0+ (Sonoma)
- Hardware: Apple Silicon Mac
- Power Adapter Type: USB-C

### Test Coverage

- Settings model validation and persistence
- UserDefaults storage and retrieval
- Settings integration with AppController
- Grace period configuration changes
- Security action selections

## Security Considerations

- [x] No secrets or sensitive data exposed
- [x] Authentication flows tested
- [x] Permissions are appropriately scoped
- [x] Security scanning passed (check workflow results)

### Security Improvements

- Removed excessive GitHub Actions permissions
- Settings stored securely in UserDefaults
- No network requests for settings sync (local only)
- Validation prevents invalid configuration states

## Checklist

## Additional Notes

### Implementation Details

- Settings changes apply immediately without requiring app restart
- Grace period validation ensures values stay within 5-30 second bounds
- Security actions maintain order for sequential execution
- Settings migration framework included for future updates

### Known Limitations

- SwiftUI settings view has 0% test coverage (UI testing requires ViewInspector - Task #16)
- Some advanced features (custom scripts, location services) show UI but aren't fully implemented
- Settings sync across devices not implemented (future enhancement)

## Post-Merge Tasks

- [x] Update CHANGELOG.md (if not using release-please)
- [ ] Notify team of breaking changes
- [ ] Update deployment documentation
- [ ] Other: Consider adding user documentation for settings
