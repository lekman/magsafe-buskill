## Summary

This PR implements the Menu Bar UI Component (Task 5) for MagSafe Guard, providing a fully functional macOS menu bar application with proper icon handling, dark/light mode support, and comprehensive documentation. The implementation addresses the critical issue where menu bar icons don't appear when running from Xcode due to Swift Package Manager limitations.

## Type of Change

- [x] âœ¨ New feature (non-breaking change which adds functionality)
- [x] ðŸ“š Documentation update
- [x] ðŸ”§ Configuration change

## Related Issue

Implements Task 5: Create Menu Bar UI Component from the project roadmap.

## Changes

### Core Implementation

- Implemented full menu bar integration using NSStatusItem with AppDelegate
- Added shield icon system (outline for disarmed, filled for armed) using SF Symbols
- Created text fallback ("MG") when SF Symbols fail to load
- Integrated authentication service for secure arm/disarm operations
- Connected power monitoring service for real-time status updates
- Added demo window for testing power monitoring functionality

### Icon Handling Improvements

- Changed from lock icons to shield icons for better visual representation
- Removed red tint color in favor of filled/outline states
- Ensured proper dark/light mode adaptation using template images
- Fixed icon visibility issues when running from Xcode

### Build System Enhancement

- Added `task run` command in Taskfile for proper app bundle creation
- Created minimal Info.plist with LSUIElement=YES for menu bar only operation
- Added `task run:debug` variant for debug builds
- Solved Swift Package Manager limitations with menu bar apps

### Documentation

- Created comprehensive menu bar app architecture guide
- Added detailed troubleshooting section for menu bar icon issues
- Updated building and running documentation with multiple solutions
- Added 7 new UI and accessibility tests to acceptance tests document

### Testing

- Updated test assertions to use new shield icon names
- Added menu bar specific acceptance tests including:
  - Icon visibility in light/dark mode
  - State changes (armed/disarmed)
  - Keyboard navigation
  - VoiceOver support
  - Demo window functionality

## Screenshots (if applicable)

The menu bar app shows:

- Shield outline icon when disarmed
- Shield filled icon when armed
- "MG" text fallback when icons fail
- Proper color adaptation in dark/light mode

## Test Strategy

### How Has This Been Tested?

- [x] Unit tests
- [x] Manual testing
- [x] Tested on physical device

### Test Configuration

- macOS Version: 13.0+ (Ventura)
- Hardware: MacBook Pro with MagSafe
- Power Adapter Type: Apple MagSafe 3

### Manual Testing Performed

- Verified menu bar icon appears correctly using `task run`
- Tested arm/disarm functionality with authentication
- Confirmed icon changes between shield outline and filled states
- Verified dark/light mode adaptation
- Tested text fallback when SF Symbols unavailable
- Confirmed demo window shows real-time power status

## Security Considerations

- [x] No secrets or sensitive data exposed
- [x] Authentication flows tested
- [x] Permissions are appropriately scoped
- [x] Security scanning passed (check workflow results)

## Checklist

- [x] My code follows the style guidelines of this project
- [x] I have performed a self-review of my own code
- [x] I have commented my code, particularly in hard-to-understand areas
- [x] I have made corresponding changes to the documentation
- [x] My changes generate no new warnings
- [x] I have added tests that prove my fix is effective or that my feature works
- [x] New and existing unit tests pass locally with my changes

## Additional Notes

### Key Technical Decisions

1. **Shield Icons**: Chose shield SF Symbols over lock icons for clearer security representation
2. **No Red Tint**: Removed color tinting to maintain consistent system appearance
3. **Text Fallback**: Added "MG" text when SF Symbols fail (common in development)
4. **App Bundle Solution**: Created Taskfile commands to build proper app bundles

### Known Limitations

- Menu bar icon may not appear when running directly from Xcode (use `task run` instead)
- SF Symbols may not load without proper app bundle structure
- Text fallback is intentional for development scenarios

### Future Enhancements

- Add menu bar icon animations during state transitions
- Implement preferences window (Task 6)
- Add auto-arm functionality based on location/network
- Consider menu bar icon badges for notifications

## Post-Merge Tasks

- [ ] Update CHANGELOG.md (if not using release-please)
- [ ] Notify team of breaking changes
- [ ] Update deployment documentation
- [ ] Other: Update taskmaster to mark Task 5 as complete
