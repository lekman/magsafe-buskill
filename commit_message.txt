refactor(ci): streamline CI/CD workflows and improve test coverage reporting

- .github/workflows/codeql.yml: use `task build` for consistent CI builds
- .github/workflows/test.yml: add test artifact uploads, remove cache-clearing clean
- Taskfile.yml: fix variable passing and simplify build to always use CI mode
- tasks/swift.yml: fix xcodebuild destination for macOS compatibility
- .codecov.yml: add mock file exclusions
- sonar-project.properties: exclude mocks from coverage
- .gitignore: allow coverage files for CI while excluding raw versions
- .swiftlint.yml: update SwiftLint configuration
- MagSafeGuardTests/: reorganize tests into Controllers/ and Models/ subdirectories
- backup/: move temporarily disabled tests to backup directory

All CI/CD commands are now testable locally:
- `task build` - minimal CI build for CodeQL
- `task test` - run tests with coverage
