# GitHub Actions Security Configuration Summary

## Current Security Setup ✅

### 1. Actions Permissions

- **Setting**: "Allow lekman, and select non-lekman, actions and reusable workflows"
- **Effect**:
  - ✅ All GitHub actions (`actions/*`, `github/*`) are allowed
  - ✅ All lekman organization actions are allowed
  - ✅ Only whitelisted third-party actions are allowed

### 2. Third-Party Actions Whitelist

The following non-GitHub, non-lekman actions are explicitly allowed:

- `codecov/codecov-action@*` - Code coverage reporting
- `returntocorp/semgrep-action@*` - Security scanning
- `trufflesecurity/trufflehog@*` - Secret detection
- `fossas/fossa-action@*` - License compliance
- `ossf/scorecard-action@*` - Security scorecard
- `snyk/actions/*@*` - Vulnerability scanning
- `swift-actions/setup-swift@*` - Swift toolchain setup
- `maxim-lobanov/setup-xcode@*` - Xcode setup
- `webiny/action-conventional-commits@*` - Commit message validation
- `softprops/action-gh-release@*` - GitHub releases
- `googleapis/release-please-action@*` - Automated releases

### 3. Additional Security Measures

#### Branch Protection

- CODEOWNERS file requires @lekman approval for:
  - All workflow files (`.github/workflows/`)
  - All custom actions (`.github/actions/`)
  - Security-related files

#### Fork PR Protection

- Fork PRs run with `pull_request` event (no secrets)
- Separate workflow for fork PR validation
- Manual approval required for first-time contributors

#### Workflow Security

- All workflows have minimal permissions
- Actions are pinned to specific SHAs
- Regular security audits via task system

### 4. Security Tasks

Run security audits and verification:

```bash
# Full security audit
task security:audit-workflows

# Verify actions whitelist
task security:verify-actions-whitelist

# Check for secrets
task security:secrets

# Pin actions to SHAs
task security:pin-actions

# Update pinned SHAs
task security:update-pins
```

### 5. Key Security Principles

1. **Defense in Depth**: Multiple layers of protection
2. **Least Privilege**: Minimal permissions for all workflows
3. **Supply Chain Security**: Pinned actions, restricted whitelist
4. **Audit Trail**: CODEOWNERS, branch protection, logs
5. **Fork Safety**: No secrets exposed to untrusted code

## Regular Maintenance

### Weekly

- Run `task security:update-pins` to update pinned SHAs
- Review Dependabot PRs for action updates

### Monthly

- Run security audit: `task security:audit-workflows`
- Verify whitelist: `task security:verify-actions-whitelist`
- Review workflow permissions

### On Change

- When adding new actions: Update whitelist, verify publisher
- When modifying workflows: Ensure minimal permissions
- After security incidents: Review and update policies
