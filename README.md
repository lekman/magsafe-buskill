# MagSafe Guard

## A Dead-Man's Cord Theft Protection Switch for Your Mac

MagSafe Guard transforms your Mac's power connection into an intelligent security guard. When armed, it instantly detects if your power cable is disconnected and triggers protective actions to secure your data - perfect for protecting your laptop in coffee shops, airports, or any public space.

### Key Features

⚡ **Instant Detection** - Responds in milliseconds when your power cable is disconnected  
🔒 **Secure Authentication** - Touch ID or password required to arm/disarm  
⏱️ **Smart Grace Period** - Prevents false alarms with configurable delay (10 seconds default)  
🎯 **Customizable Actions** - From simple screen lock to full system shutdown  
📍 **Location Aware** - Automatically arms in public spaces, disarms at trusted locations  
🔌 **Universal Compatibility** - Works with any Mac power adapter (MagSafe, USB-C, or third-party)

### How It Works

1. **Arm the protection** when working in public spaces
2. **Continue working normally** with your power adapter connected
3. **If someone grabs your laptop**, the power cable disconnects
4. **Security actions trigger** immediately (or after grace period)
5. **Your data stays protected** even if your laptop is stolen

Perfect for digital nomads, security-conscious professionals, and anyone who works with sensitive data in public spaces.

## Acknowledgments

MagSafe Guard is inspired by the excellent work of the [BusKill Project](https://github.com/BusKill/buskill-app) - an open-source laptop kill cord that uses a USB magnetic breakaway to trigger security actions. We deeply appreciate their pioneering work in this space and their commitment to open-source security tools.

While BusKill requires a physical USB cable attachment, MagSafe Guard adapts the concept to use your existing power connection, making it seamless for Mac users. We encourage you to check out the original BusKill project, especially if you need cross-platform support or prefer a dedicated hardware solution.

Special thanks to:

- The [BusKill team](https://github.com/BusKill) for creating the original concept and implementation
- [Michael Altfield](https://github.com/maltfield) and all BusKill contributors
- The open-source security community for continuous innovation

## Intended Usage

MagSafe Guard is fully open source software, licensed under the [MIT License](LICENSE). We believe in transparency and community-driven development for security tools.

## Development

> **Note:** MagSafe Guard is an Xcode project. For the best development experience, use Xcode for building, running, and testing. The command-line tools mentioned below are primarily for CI/CD automation.

### Quick Start

1. **Install Task** (if not already installed):

   ```bash
   brew install go-task/tap/go-task
   ```

2. **Initialize Development Environment**:

   ```bash
   task init
   ```

   This sets up git hooks and verifies your development tools.

3. **Build and Run**:

   ```bash
   # Open in Xcode (recommended)
   open MagSafeGuard.xcodeproj
   ```

   In Xcode:

   - Press `⌘B` to build
   - Press `⌘R` to run
   - Look for the lock shield icon in your menu bar

### Testing

**For Development Testing:**

- Use Xcode's Test Navigator (`⌘5`)
- Press `⌘U` to run all tests
- Use the demo window in the app to test power detection

**For CI/CD Pipeline:**

The following tasks are used by our automated CI/CD pipeline and are not needed for normal development:

```bash
task test           # Run all tests (CI/CD)
task test:security  # Run security checks (CI/CD)
task lint          # Run linters (CI/CD)
task pre-push      # Pre-push checks (CI/CD)
```

## System Requirements

- macOS 11.0 (Big Sur) or later
- Any Mac with power adapter support
- Administrator privileges for some security actions
