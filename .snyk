          This is a legitimate use of evaluatePolicy for a security application.
          We require biometric authentication as part of our security model.
          Comprehensive security measures have been implemented including:
          rate limiting, input validation, fresh authentication contexts,
          production security checks, and attempt tracking.
          See docs/security/snyk-evaluatepolicy-justification.md for details.
