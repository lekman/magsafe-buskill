import Foundation

/// Comprehensive settings model for MagSafe Guard configuration.
///
/// This structure contains all user-configurable settings for the application,
/// organized into logical groups for security, auto-arm, notifications, and general preferences.
/// All settings are persisted automatically and can be exported/imported as JSON.
///
/// ## Validation
///
/// The model includes built-in validation for critical settings:
/// - Grace period is constrained to 5-30 seconds
/// - Security actions maintain execution order
/// - Network names are validated for basic format
///
/// ## Usage
///
/// ```swift
/// var settings = Settings()
/// settings.gracePeriodDuration = 15.0
/// settings.securityActions = [.lockScreen, .shutdown]
/// ```
///
/// Settings are automatically validated when modified through `UserDefaultsManager`.
